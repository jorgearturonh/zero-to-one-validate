# Find Similar Startups - Idea Validation API

Find Similar Startups is an application that helps evaluate startup ideas through the lens of Peter Thiel's book Zero to One. Instead of focusing on traditional competition, this project encourages users to think about innovation through the lens of building something truly uniqueâ€”moving from "zero" (creating something new) to "one" (establishing a groundbreaking solution).

## Features

- **Real-time Idea Analysis**: Submit your startup ideas and receive live updates through WebSocket connections
- **Automated Research**: The system performs comprehensive analysis using AI and web scraping
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup/login system with email verification
- **History Tracking**: Authenticated users can view their past idea validations
- **Detailed Results**: Get insights about search results, competitor analysis, and market opportunities
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor token usage and associated costs for each analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Langchain, Mongoose
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO for live updates
- **Authentication:** JWT with email verification
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI/Azure OpenAI
- **Search:** Serper API for Google search results

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```
MONGO_URI=
CLIENT_ORIGIN=
SERPER_API_KEY=
MAX_AMOUNT_OF_SEARCH_QUERIES=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
APP_URL=
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_FROM=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=
JWT_SECRET=
```

If you want to disable verbose mode add

`DISABLE_VERBOSE=true`

You can modify the max amount of queries to be generated by AI with (this will spend more Serper API tokens)

`MAX_AMOUNT_OF_SEARCH_QUERIES=10`

### Real-time Updates

The application uses Socket.IO to provide real-time updates during idea analysis. This approach offers several benefits:

- Live progress tracking of the analysis process
- Immediate feedback on search results and competitor findings
- Reduced server load compared to polling
- Better user experience with instant updates

### Running the Project

Make sure to use Node v20 you can install directly from [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), or use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```bash
nvm use 20
```

Clone the project

  git clone https://github.com/jorgearturonh/zero-to-one-validate
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd zero-to-one-validate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Start the server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Usage recommendations
